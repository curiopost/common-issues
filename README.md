# Common Issues

### 1. Unable to open image gallery when creating a post or a question or adding an avatar

To fix this follow the steps:

1. Open settings on your device.
2. Go to app permissions and search for the browser your using Curiopost on.
3. Make sure the permission for accessing the storage and images is enabled, if its not enable it.
4. If it still doesn't work then, clear the cache of the browser
5. Your problem should be resolved :)

### 2. Not recieving verification Email

Sometimes you might not see the verification email sent to you when you visit, if it happens then try reading these:

1. If your using an icloud email, then sorry we can't send you emails cos icloud blocks our emails. You'll have to use some other email provider.
2. Check your spam / junk folder.
3. If you still don't see it, then you can trigger a resent, by heading over to: https://curiopost.live/login and logging in with your username and password.

### 3. My issue is not here
