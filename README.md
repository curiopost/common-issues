# Common Issues

### 1. Getting an error: "Could not verify your account. Your account is most likely already verified, you can login with your credentials you entered here" 

If you get this error when verifying the email, then its because, the link has been clicked before, even if you did not click this, this can still happen because some of your email providers might already click and visit the link. This is mostly done to ensure that the link is not malicious. 

**Solution**

If this happened simply login at: https://curiopost.live/login with the credentials you entered during registration, and done.

### 2. Unable to open image gallery when creating a post or a question or adding an avatar

To fix this follow the steps:

1. Open settings on your device.
2. Go to app permissions and search for the browser your using Curiopost on.
3. Make sure the permission for accessing the storage and images is enabled, if its not enable it.
4. If it still doesn't work then, clear the cache of the browser
5. Your problem should be resolved :)

### 3 Not recieving verification Email

Sometimes you might not see the verification email sent to you when you visit, if it happens then try reading these:

1. If your using an icloud email, then sorry we can't send you emails cos icloud blocks our emails. You'll have to use some other email provider.
2. Check your spam / junk folder.
3. If you still don't see it, then you can trigger a resend, by heading over to: https://curiopost.live/login and logging in with your username and password.

### 4. Site just blank

If the site is just blank when you visit the page, first try reloading the page, then if it is still blank, go to your browser settings and seee if JavaScript is enabled.

### 5. My issue is not here

If your issue is not here, then it most likely is a bug, you can report it [here](https://bugs.curiopost.live/)
